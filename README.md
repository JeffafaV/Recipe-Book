# Recipe-Book
A C++ project that simulates a recipe book with the added functionality of checking which 
dishes the user can make with the ingredients they currently have. User must insert any 
currently available ingredients they have as well as inserting any dishes they want 
and their details such as ingredients, recipe, and name. The program will then search for 
all dishes the user is able to prepare by comparing each dish's ingredients and the user's 
currently available ingredients. This project is a work in progress.
